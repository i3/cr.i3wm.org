    "Comment": "The reason for this patch is that VPN tunnels managed by nmcli or nm-applet do not get a pidfile, and can thus not make use of the run_watch directive.\nChecking for the existance of the dynamic tun0 directory under /proc works however.\n\nI was considering generalizing this function to something like \"file_status\" adding support for checking more things, like contents of the file. But I don't have a clear use case so I started with this.\n\nFeedback appreciated.",
