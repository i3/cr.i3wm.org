Subject: [PATCH] Bugfix: reset last_timestamp for each event

Reset last_timestamp to XCB_CURRENT_TIME whenever a new event comes in.
This should be set to the value of the timestamp for the incoming event
for any event that contains a timestamp during event handling. For
events that do not contain a timestamp, this avoids using an old
timestamp when rendering which can lead to focus problems when a
timestamp is used multiple times for handling different events.

fixes #1383
