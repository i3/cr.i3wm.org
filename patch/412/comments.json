    "Comment": "Yes, the changes to this test are required for this test to pass because of the changes to src/x.c.\n\nInputHint now overrides the WM_TAKE_FOCUS protocol. When the InputHint is set, WM_TAKE_FOCUS is ignored.\n\nInputHint is a flag on the WM_HINTS property. When WM_HINTS is not present, i3 treats the window as if the InputHint is set. Thus when WM_HINTS is not present, the WM_TAKE_FOCUS protocol is ignored. `open_window` does not set the WM_HINTS property on the window. `delete_hint` works by adding an empty WM_HINTS property where the InputHint is unset so that the protocol will not be ignored.\n\nIf that behavior does not sound correct to you, I can make an argument of why it is. But in general, I believe WM_HINTS can be expected to be set.",
