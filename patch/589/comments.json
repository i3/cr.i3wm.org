    "Comment": "Not sure why you do this. It could change control flow, e.g. it’s not obvious to me that con_update_parents_urgency() which is called later is not necessary to call, even when the container’s urgency stays the same. Same for the timers.\n\nIf you really want to have this change, i suggest putting it into a separate patch and focusing on the window::urgent event in this patch :).",
