I added this code:\n\n    if (con_get_workspace(con) == NULL \u0026\u0026 !(con-\u003etype == CT_OUTPUT || con-\u003etype == CT_ROOT || con-\u003etype == CT_DOCKAREA)) {\n        DLOG(\"WRONG, type == %d, layout %d \\n\", con-\u003etype, con-\u003elayout);\n    }\n\nThen I ran the testsuite and grepped for WRONG, finding many instances.",
