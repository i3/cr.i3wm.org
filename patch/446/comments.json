    "Comment": "As a general comment: I’m not yet convinced that exchanging strncmp for another comparison is actually a win. Modern compilers are supposed to optimize the strcmp function family into highly optimized assembler code. Did you check the resulting assembler code and verified that your changes actually make it faster? (Sounds tedious, but with optimizations at this level, I’d rather have some data to justify such a commit.)",
