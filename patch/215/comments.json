Consider this: an evil attacker presses a\u003cENTER\u003ea\u003cENTER\u003ea\u003cENTER\u003eâ€¦ to generate a lot of processes due to fork()ing. PAM blocks a specific amount of time when validating a wrong password to prevent brute-force attacks. In this case, the attacker might be quick enough to make the machine run out of resources due to too many processes.",
