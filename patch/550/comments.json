    "Comment": "The wording is not entirely precise. I suggest rewriting the paragraph like this to be more consistent with the rest of the document:\n\n“By default, when switching focus to a window on a different output (e.g. focusing a window on workspace 3 on output VGA-1, coming from workspace 2 on LVDS-1), the mouse cursor is warped to the center of that window.\n\nWith the +mouse_warping+ option, you can control when the mouse cursor should be warped. +none+ disables warping entirely, whereas +output+ is the default behavior described above.”",
