The known bug that we’d introduce is really bothering me.\n\nTherefore, I decided to go ahead and revert koebis original commit and implement\nhttp://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3lock/commit/?id=ac8bbad523c45085061b77ce1bcbc0381306ce8b instead.\n\nThank you nevertheless for the patch submissions, I appreciate your work on this — even if it ultimately only showed us that this approach is not worthwhile. Thanks! :)",
