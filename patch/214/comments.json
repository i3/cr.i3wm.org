The manpage says “The err(), verr(), errx(), and verrx() functions do not return, but exit with the value of the argument eval.”\n\nThis will effectively unlock the screen when fork() fails for some reason — not a good idea :).\n\nPlease implement a fallback to directly calling pam_authenticate etc. blockingly. Some more refactoring will be necessary to get there from the current state of your patch, but we need to get this right.\n",
