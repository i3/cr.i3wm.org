    "Comment": "Okay, then we should define the desired behaviour. Currently, it is not possible to have a percentage sign in the config strings, hence something like \"0%\" is impossible. (which would maintain the current behaviour).\nI can add this feature (possibility to use \"%%\"). Should then the format also be \"%volume%%\" (and format_muted \"0%%\")? This would make i3status behave differently for the same config...",
