I’m not sure if that works with our current build infrastructure, but I think it should, so please give it a go :).\n\nThe advantage of using a symbol is that the debugger can actually understand that, i.e. you’ll retain the information that one string constant is used in three different places, whereas with a #define the preprocessor replaces the string and the debugger will not be able to tell.",
