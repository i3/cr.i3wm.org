    "Comment": "Sorry, I have no idea why it might be so, but noticed the message spawning huge numbers of times.\n\nFor example, when putting an urxvt tail-ing the i3 log in fullscreen, nothing happens. When exiting fullscreen, the message appears 68 times, all with the same displayed DPI. Same happens when switching workspace. I do absolutely not know why this happens, but so it does. And I do not notice anything changing on the screen.\n\nThe only reason I can find is a really small change, or a FPU error on floating points that makes the value change.\n\nBTW, I first noticed this message when updating to xorg to 1.14 and linux to 3.12, maybe is that part of the reason.\n\nCheers \u0026 HTH,\n\nLeo",
