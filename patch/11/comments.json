    "Comment": "This patch is now obsolete because of another patch fixing the issue described in paragraph 1 of the commit message.\n\nBut paragraph 2 and 3 are still worth having a look. Basically, moving the resizing code to the scratchpad_move() function could avoid checking the state on every scratchpad_show() call and thus, make the SCRATCHPAD_FRESH state obsolete. Please give me your view on this.\n\n-- Vivien",
