Subject: [PATCH 2/2] i3bar: Realign tray clients on UnmapNotify

UnmapNotify events are interpreted by i3bar as an action taken by an
application to hide its tray window. We respond by adjusting the size of
the tray window and realigning any tray clients that remain. This will
close the gap left by the unmapping window.

Breaking change! The tray will not be properly readjusted if the
application remaps its tray window.
