    "Comment": "I’m not convinced. Intentionally, i3bar is not very customizable, but comes in a reasonable default configuration. I think background color is too obnoxious, i.e. it makes the bar too prominent. The bar is supposed to be something at which you only look on occasion, e.g. to check the current time or free disk space before starting a download.",
