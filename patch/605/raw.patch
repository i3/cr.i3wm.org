Subject: [PATCH] Bugfix: don't focus unmapped container on manage

A window may become unmapped on manage when an assignment command unmaps
the window, such as moving it to the scratchpad or killing it.

This can cause i3 focus to be an unmapped window and different than X
focus which can lead to complications

fixes #1283
