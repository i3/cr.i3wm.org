    "Comment": "To be honest, I’m not sure I want to merge that. Sure, one can argue that having clean data types until the very last moment is cleaner than hard-coded JSON strings.\n\nThen again, this adds a substantial amount of code and I don’t think changes like this one benefit the reader of the code:\n\n-    ipc_send_event(\"workspace\", I3_IPC_EVENT_WORKSPACE, \"{\\\"change\\\":\\\"rename\\\"}\");\n+    send_workspace_event(E_CHANGE_RENAME, NULL, NULL);\n\nI am still interested in the fixes for the edge cases you mention, though. Can you submit a new patch to fix those without refactoring the event sending?",
