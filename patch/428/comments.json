In order to be able to safely refactor the code, I need to make sure that the tests cover all cases and although the coverage reports claims full branch coverage, I still need to locate and check the relevant tests to make sure that the focus state is verified for all cases.\n\nIf nobody else does chime in, I will be working on and off on this issue, but don't expect a solution soon.\n\nI will add a TODO with my next patch to highlight the fact that the function should be removed when ticket #1185 get fixed.",
