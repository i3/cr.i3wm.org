Subject: [PATCH] Fix mouse resize in nested containers

Currently, when resizing a container with mod+mouse (right click) and
the currently focused container is the first (clicking next to the
left/top border) or the last (right/bottom border) node in the queue,
resizing would fail. With this patch, i3 now searches for a parent
container with the desired orientation.

fixes #1084
