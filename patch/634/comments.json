    "Comment": "Is there anything wrong with using con-\u003ecurrent_border_width directly, instead of deriving it from con_border_style_rect in a more or less obfuscating way:\n\nleft   : br.x\nright  : br.x + br.width\ntop    : br.y\nbottom : br.y + br.height\n\nIs it because current_border_width could be \u003c 0? I thought about this but learned that the border widths are always explicitly set to the defaults when the window becomes managed [1]. By the way, wouldn't this render this very first check in con_border_style_rect redundant [2]?\n\nOr should \"br\" rather be used to reflect the possibly hidden edges? Which, however, already happens here in x_draw_decoration before calling the individual xcb_poly_fill_rectangle functions...\n\nAnd you accepted my other patch [3] that uses current_border_width while it could have resorted to con_border_style_rect as well :)\n\nI'd only like to know why the less clear way is more preferable here?\n\n[1] http://c.i3wm.org/6bf7f8ef\n[2] http://code.stapelberg.de/git/i3/tree/src/con.c?h=next#n1077\n[3] http://cr.i3wm.org/patch/633",
