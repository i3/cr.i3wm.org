I had focus in one window (and the window is\nactive), however when I type it ends up in another window.\n\nUnfortunately I jumped in and out of windows trying to figure out what\nwas going on. The problem I saw was the jetbrains/intellij window had\nfocus, I typed and it ended up in gnome-terminal. Switching to another\nworkspace and back seemed to fix it, and the last few characters typed\nended up in the correct window.\n\nSo the problem is from this log, before switching workspace to 2 and\nthen back to 1 again.\n\n\u003e\u003e\u003e",
