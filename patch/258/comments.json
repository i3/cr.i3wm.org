Unfortunately, I cannot merge it, because it\n violates one of my rules with regards to i3lock: any kind of image\n processing (cropping, resizing, converting, â€¦, blurring!) will not be\n accepted and needs to be done outside of i3lock, e.g. in a custom\n script.\n\n This rule is in place so that the i3lock source code stays small and\n does not duplicate functionality that is already present in countless\n graphical tools.\n\n Thanks for understanding.",
