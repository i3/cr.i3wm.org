    "Comment": "Because otherwise it doubles the amount if syscalls performed to retrieve basic wireless info (excluding %bitrate), and has a measurable effect on cpu consumption: on my laptop 500000 cycles with only wireless info go from 4.2s (2.4/1.8 user/kernel) to 5.4 (2.7/2.7 user/kernel).  As I understand, after we have successfully retrieved ifidx, it can only change when the interface is totally gone, and another interface has taken its place (so you'd need to, like, shuffle two usb adapters to achieve that).  If you insist on handling that, how about dropping the cache only when scan results are empty?",
