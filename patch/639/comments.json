    "Comment": "Ok thanks for the answer. This still seems to be odd. Because with this patch the behavior keeps the same: If resized floating window is put to scratchpad the size will not change.\nBut it's much more comfortable to just open a window (a.e. a bash) and put it via hotkey from tiling directly into the Scratchpad and have it's size usable.\nInstead now, I've ot open a window, put it to floating, resize it and then can add it to the scratchpad which is much more overhead. Perhaps you could think about your decision again?",
