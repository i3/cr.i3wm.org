    "Comment": "I don’t think this patch is a good addition. i3-msg is supposed to be a simple reference implementation of _basic_ IPC communication. Subscribing to events is better left to third-party libraries and scripts in a high-level language. Doing what you propose in shell is definitely not a clean approach :).",

    "Comment": "SUBSCRIBE is the only IPC message left not handled by i3-msg, and this is still very basic (it just requires a subsequent receive). Many command line tools such as dbus-monitor and inotifywait offer this capability, while the raw output is left to the user.\n\nI think SUBSCRIBE should be handled in a basic way. Is there another approach to this patch that may change your mind about this feature?",
