    "Comment": "This is an interesting read: wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix\n\nIt turns out that a \"kilobyte\" is actually 1000 bytes because in SI, \"kilo\" always means 1000. This is conventionally the unit of measurement hard drives are *sold* in (probably because it inflates the size of the drive compared to binary).\n\nA unit consisting of 1024 bytes is called a \"kibibyte\" (which is an ugly word that means \"kilo-binary byte\"). This is the unit of measurement computers conventionally give users when they request human readable file sizes.",

    "Comment": "At first I thought about naming the options: iec_binary, si_decimal, and custom(ary)_binary. But this seemed to convey somewhat redundant information, that would be better off to be found here in the docs.\n\nWith “custom” I mean “made by/for oneself”, i.e., for Michael, who merged this patch already. So I think he is fine with this naming...",
