Subject: [PATCH] Fix battery indicator on systems without
 POWER_SUPPLY_VOLTAGE_NOW.

In my case, the voltage variable would stay initialized as -1,
which caused the calculation of battery charge percentage to be
incorrect (I would get the message that there is no battery present
or even -0% charge).

I have no idea how this would affect other systems, since I don't
have a chance to test this.
