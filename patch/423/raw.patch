Subject: [PATCH] i3bar: Do not kill watcher on EOF

Wait for the child process to exit on its own before freeing
watcher-related resources.

i3bar shows the last received status line until the process exits.

Fixes a race condition where the termination signal was sometimes not
received to display a meaningful error message.
