Subject: [PATCH] Prevent an infinite loop when an output is disabled

When looping over workspaces to reassign them from the output being
disabled, be sure to remove them from the loop. Do not rely on
tree_close to do this, because tree_close refuses to close a workspace
that is visible.

fixes #1103.
