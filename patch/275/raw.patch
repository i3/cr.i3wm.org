+This event is the result of an issued +event+ command usualy bound to a 
+keybinding.  The event names are custom and variable, but the message type
+will allways be the same, because of this the name of the triggered event
+is included along with the payload. See the i3 userguide for more information
+on the +event+ command.

+=== custom event
+
+The +event+ command is an advanced feature to pass messages to connected IPC 
+clients.  This allows scripters to run services that respond to commands
+processed by i3.
+
+*Syntax*:
+---------------
+event <event_name> <event_data>
+---------------
+
+<event_name> is required and can be any single word.
+<event_data> is required and can be any valid string.
+
+Any IPC clients subscribed to the event matching <event_name> will receive an
+event with a JSON blob containing the event_name and event_data sent. e.g.
+
+*Example*:
+---------------
+# If bound to a key press
+bindsym $mod+y event test "Hello World"
+
+# The following JSON will be received by all connect IPC clients subscribed
+# to the test event when $mod+y is pressed:
+{"event": "test", "Hello World"}
