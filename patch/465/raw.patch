Subject: [PATCH] Perform minute alignment for refreshes only once per minute

This patch ensures that the minute alignment for refreshes is only
done once per minute to make sure that the refresh interval time
is obeyed as much as possible after a refresh has been forced from
the outside. This also reduces the total number of refreshs in such
cases.
