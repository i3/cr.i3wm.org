    "Comment": "Personally, I find powers of 1000 easier to work with than powers of 1024 :)\n\nBut that’s not really the reason why I submitted this patch. It’s more about the unambiguity that comes along with using the standardized prefixes¹, especially the binary ones. There are numerous programs that adopted this form, e.g., pacman, gdisk, aria2c, …\n\nBut there’s also software that uses the SI prefixes with their actual decimal meaning: apt-get, dd, fdisk, and most prominently OS X throughout the entire system².\n\n¹ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_80000-13\n² https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix#Current_practice",
