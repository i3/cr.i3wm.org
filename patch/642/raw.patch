Subject: [PATCH] Do not resend focus on click

Do not set focused_id to XCB_NONE in route click to force resend focus,
in some cases to an already focused window.

Sending focus again on click is not necessary and may cause problems
with certain wine or mono apps. Resending focus makes combo boxes not
work in Office 2010.
