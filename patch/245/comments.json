Granted, the functionality is not very useful (I think), but is it bad enough to forbid it and risk breakage? I don’t think so. You can always reach any workspace by adressing it directly, e.g. “workspace \"1: foo\"”.",

But according to me, I would prefer to have this warning (making the highlight on \"x: \" being a number for the workspace btw), rather than having the possibility to reuse a number and break the expected behavior of commands such as \"workspace next_on_output\".\n\nI mean, breaking the next_on_output binding is more annoying than not being able to reuse an existing number (which is weird).",
