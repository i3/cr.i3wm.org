Please split them up into smaller commits that are more easily understandable and re-submit.\n\nI.e., submit one patch for the “XEMBED_EMBEDDED_NOTIFY gets sent at the wrong time” problem, one for the different handling of UnmapNotify events, etc. Ideally each of these patches should not break the tray, but I value clarity over breakage in this case.",
