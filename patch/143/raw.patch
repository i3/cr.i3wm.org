 A split container can have one of the following layouts:
 
-splith/splitv::
-Windows are sized so that every window gets an equal amount of space in the
-container. splith distributes the windows horizontally (windows are right next
-to each other), splitv distributes them vertically (windows are on top of each
-other).
+splitting::
+Windows are sized so that every window gets an equal amount of space
+in the container.  By default the split line will be parallel to the
+container's longest side, but commands are available to require
+vertical or horizontal splitting when it is done.
 stacking::
 Only the focused window in the container is displayed. You get a list of
 windows at the top of the container.
