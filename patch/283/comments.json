    "Comment": "AFAICT, this will allow the following behavior:\n\n1) Attacker enters wrong password.\n2) Attacker enters good password.\n3) i3lock immediately unlocks, without waiting for the wrong attempt in ① to finish.\n\nSo this effectively reduces PAM’s security feature of waiting for n seconds on a wrong password entry by a factor of 4.\n\nI don’t think that’s reasonable behavior — we should wait until _all_ children are terminated before unlocking.\n\nI think the simplest approach is some kind of queue where key presses go, so that they are buffered and can be handled once the child terminated.",
