    "Comment": "Subtle detail: you need to create a new connection for subscriptions to work reliably, otherwise there may be race conditions.\n\nAlso, I think a good strategy here is to have an array of all workspace events, then force sending a workspace event by switching to a different workspace and afterwards verifying that there are no “empty” workspace events in the array.\n\nTry something like this (untested):\n\nmy @events;\nmy $ws_event_conn = i3(get_socket_path(0));\n$ws_event_conn-\u003econnect()-\u003erecv;\n$ws_event_conn-\u003esubscribe({\n  workspace =\u003e sub {\n    my ($event) = @_;\n    push @events, $event;\n  }\n});\n\n# …\n\n# Wait for the workspace event on a new connection. Events will be delivered to older connections earlier, so by the time it arrives here, it should be in @events already.\nmy $ws_event_block_conn = i3(get_socket_path(0));\n$ws_event_block_conn-\u003econnect()-\u003erecv;\n$ws_event_block_conn-\u003esubscribe({ workspace =\u003e sub { $cond-\u003esend(1) }});\n$cond-\u003erecv;\n\nmy @expected_events = grep { $_-\u003e{change} eq 'focus' } @events;\nmy @empty_events = grep { $_-\u003e{change} eq 'empty' } @events;\nis(@expected_events, 1, 'Expected event found');\nis(@empty_events, 0, 'No \"empty\" events');",
