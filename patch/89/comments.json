You can reproduce it with this:\n\n1) put this in the config and reload it:\nfor_window [instance=\"^urxvt_floating$\"] floating enable; border pixel 10\n2) run urxvt -name urxvt_floating\n\nthe focused window will have border pixel 10.. also, if you unhide the floating windows you will see that the floating window doesn't have border pixel 10.\n",

    "Comment": "for the above bug, looks like this works:\nfor_window [instance=\"^urxvt_floating$\"] border pixel 10; floating enable\n\nbecause it chage the border pixel first and then the floating.\n\n\nanother bug:\n\n1) put window A in floating mode\n2) move window B in scratchpad and the do scratchpad show\n3) hide floating windows so only window B will be shown\n4) focus window B\n4) do focus (left|right|up|down)\n\nresult:\nwindow B does not have focus (i.e. focus is on window A)\n\nexpected:\nwindow B must have focus. we can not focus to window A, because floating windows are hidden.",

I need to mark all the children as unmapped so x_push_changes(con) is enough for hiding the current con.\n\nI'm eager to solve this in another way, but I don't see how, the only thing that comes to my mind is to just call tree_render at the end of the function.",
