    "Comment": "Hi Michael. The reason is pretty simple. I've recently switched to a dual band wireless router, so my speed changes frequently and typical values with %g are: 96, 130, 166.6 and so on. This change the length of the text in my bar, and it distracts me a lot, so I've switched to %5.1f.",
