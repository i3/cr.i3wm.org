I have some ideas I will post to the bug tracker issue on how to handle bindings to the window area.\n\nOther than that, I think the last thing to do is mouse bindings to the bar, which I think will be mostly independent of this.",

Merging them as early as possible into “next” after a release is a much better way. Every release is costly in terms of manpower and distribution, so I’d like to avoid dot releases.",
