If we allow _any_ feature like this into the code base, we’d need to accept _all_ other similar features as well. After all, why would your centering be more important than some other user’s tinting? Both are simple, so following your logic, we should have them. And then some other user comes with transparency. And then rounded corners. And then…\n\nSee also https://faq.i3wm.org/question/778/why-is-patch-not-merged-and-made-optional/",
