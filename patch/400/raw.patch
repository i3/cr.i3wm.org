Subject: [PATCH] Document the existence of a C ipc project

Add a link to https://github.com/acrisci/i3-ipc which is a new ipc
library in the design phase of development. When it is stable, it will
provide bindings to many high-level scripting languages with
GObject-introspection.

This project aims to replace the unmaintained Python library and offer
an ipc library in new languages such as Lua and JavaScript.
